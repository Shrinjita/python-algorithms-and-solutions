# Python Algorithms and Solutions

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains Python scripts covering a diverse range of algorithmic and problem-solving tasks. It includes solutions for:
- 🔹 **Graph algorithms:** BFS, DFS, A* Search, etc.
- 🔹 **Dynamic programming:** Knapsack, rod cutting, min jumps, etc.
- 🔹 **Mathematical operations:** Factorial stack, slab rearrangement, etc.
- 🔹 **AI and game simulations:** Autonomous vehicle negotiation, Sudoku solver, and voting systems.
